    "# 🧠 What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized subset of **Machine Learning (ML)** that involves training **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** with multiple layers — hence the term “deep”.\n",
    "\n",
    "It draws inspiration from the **structure and function of the human brain**, where networks of interconnected neurons process information.\n",

    "## 🎯 Core Concepts of Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 1. Representation Learning\n",
    "Deep learning models automatically **learn feature representations** from data. Unlike traditional ML where feature engineering is manual, DL architectures discover useful patterns **end-to-end** from raw input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 2. Hierarchical Abstraction\n",
    "Each layer in a deep neural network learns a different level of abstraction:\n",
    "- **Lower layers**: learn basic features (e.g., edges, textures)\n",
    "- **Middle layers**: learn patterns (e.g., shapes, corners)\n",
    "- **Higher layers**: learn semantic features (e.g., faces, objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially effective in domains like **vision**, **speech**, and **natural language processing**.\n",
